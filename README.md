This is a Java program for calculating the profit in Palia in agriculture. The following calculations can be realized with the information collected using a scanner: Production yield of the fields, - minus the products required for seed production, monetary profit from all fields, monetary profit per minute. Of course, these calculations can also be made relatively easily by hand. However, this is just a little gimmick of mine and may be of benefit to some people.
The following information is required: Description of the product, how many fields are to be covered with the product, how high is the production of the product per field, selling price of a product, how many seeds are produced by the seed machine per product and how many minutes the seed machine needs to produce seeds. However, these variables can also be fixed if required, but have been left open to cover possible changes on the part of the game.

This program was created for my lovely girlfriend and is dedicated to her!

Have fun with it!

Palia is a free game for the Nintendo Switch and Windows. It is comparable to Animal Crossing (donÂ´t hate me for this Comparison)
